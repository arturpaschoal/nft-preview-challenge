## Overview

For me, this looked like a simple challenge, but while I was doing and when I saw the active project, it was way harder for me as a begginer to do, expecially the image on top of another with a hover. But I did it, hope it's good, I think it is kind of well built and I calculated a lot of things so I hope you guys like it!!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Well my process was basically analysing the designs that were given to me and executing the project the way I thought it could be done, I wanted to start with the picture and so I did, and then I structured the body of the nft so the image could fit inside of it, and then I did the hovers and the paragraphs and the horizontal rule!

### Built with

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to style the basics of an NFT and how to hover images on top of other images, I followed the advice that some people in the frontend mentor community gave me and it worked very well, it was even easier to do the beggining of the code and I was very happy that I had learned new things. I want to learn more and to be faster to make these projects so hint me up and judge my code, your help is always welcome!!
